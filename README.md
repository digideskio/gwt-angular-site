Introduction
============

#### Live Demo URL --> http://kyoken74.github.io/gwt-angular/
The demo application gwt-angular-site demonstrates the usage of gwt-angular
API in a live application (documentation).

The demo application uses Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) as
the view framework.

### WARNING
The API is in very early stages of development, and it is not yet ready for
beta.


Collaborators Wanted
====================
Although I have many years of Java and GWT development experience, my 
understanding of AngularJS is na√Øve at best. If any AngularJS experts out 
there who can help me understand the core design philosophy of this powerful 
framework, please let me know. I can use your help.

You may have figured out that this is a one-man project started in his 
kitchen (I do not have a garage). There is no corporate sponsor behind this 
project.


Getting Started
===============

### Building the project
Set up [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) on your machine, and then execute 
the following commands to build the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/kyoken74/gwt-angular.git
cd gwt-angular
mvn clean install
```

### Running the Live Demo
gwt-angular-site contains the source code for our Live Demo site.

If you have a JEE container, you can simply deploy the following WAR 
artifact to your server after building the project.
```
gwt-angular/gwt-angular-site/gwt-angular-web/gwt-angular.war
```

If you have a web server, you can expand the above WAR file, and deploy the
extracted code to your web server's htdocs area. You can discard the 
META-INF and WEB-INF directories, because they are only relevant to JEE 
containers.
```
gwt-angular.war
	/site
	/index.html
	/sitemap.xml
```

If you plan to run the site for development, please note that only 
SuperDevMode is supported. HostedMode (DevMode) is not supported. You can 
set up the SuperDevMode for gwt-angular-web project.

Main Class
	com.google.gwt.dev.codeserver.CodeServer

Main Argument
	-src src/test/java com.asayama.gwt.angular.site.SuperDevMode

Required JAR
	gwt-codeserver.jar


Overview
========
The purpose of gwt-angular project is to bring the powerful MVC framework of
AngularJS to Java programmers.

gwt-angular provides a GWT wrapper around AngularJS, so that the controller
component of AngularJS can be written in Java language, in a manner that is 
natural to a programmer with little background in JavaScript but with
more experience in Java. gwt-angular aims to bridge the gap in paradigm.

The purpose of gwt-angular is to introduce a clear separation between the 
view and controller for GWT developers, which has been a challenge. The 
views are intended to be written in HTML/CSS, and, as such, gwt-angular does 
not provide any view components (i.e. widgets) in Java. The users are  
encouraged to explorer various HTML based view frameworks.
