gwt-angular
===========

The purpose of gwt-angular project is to bring the powerful MVC framework of
AngularJS to Java programmers.

gwt-angular provides a GWT wrapper around AngularJS, so that the controller
component of AngularJS can be written in Java language, in a manner that is 
more natural to a programmer with little background in JavaScript but come with
more experience in Java.

The purpose of gwt-angular is to introduce a clear separation between the view
and controller. The views are intended to be written in HTML/CSS, and, as such,
gwt-angular does not provide any view components (i.e. widgets) in Java. The 
users are  encouraged to explorer various HTML based view frameworks. (The demo
application gwt-angular-demo uses Twitter's Bootstrap.)
