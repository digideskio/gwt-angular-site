WARNING
=======

The API is in very early stages of development, and it is not yet ready for
beta.

Collaborators Wanted
====================

Although I have many years of Java and GWT development experience, my 
understanding of AngularJS is na√Øve at best. If any AngularJS experts out there
who can help me understand the core design philosophy of this powerful 
framework, please let me know. I can use your help.

You may have figured out that this is a one-man project started in his kitchen
(I do not have a garage). There is no corporate sponsor behind this project.


Core API (gwt-angular)
======================

The purpose of gwt-angular project is to bring the powerful MVC framework of
AngularJS to Java programmers.

gwt-angular provides a GWT wrapper around AngularJS, so that the controller
component of AngularJS can be written in Java language, in a manner that is 
more natural to a programmer with little background in JavaScript but come with
more experience in Java. gwt-angular aims to bridge the gap in paradigm.

The purpose of gwt-angular is to introduce a clear separation between the view
and controller for GWT developers, which has been a challenge. The views are 
intended to be written in HTML/CSS, and, as such, gwt-angular does not provide 
any view components (i.e. widgets) in Java. The users are  encouraged to 
explorer various HTML based view frameworks.

GWT (http://www.gwtproject.org)

AngularJS (http://angularjs.org/)


Demo App (gwt-angular-demo)
===========================

The demo application gwt-angular-demo demonstrates the usage of gwt-angular API
in a live application. It is more a documentation than an application.

The demo application uses Twitter's Bootstrap as the view framework.

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com)


Building the Project
====================

Set up Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org)

Clone the repository or download the source code, go into gwt-angular directory
and execute the below command.

```
mvn clean install
```

Versioning
==========

0.0.x development will continue in develop branch, and with every release, we
will increment the patch number. The programming interface will remain unstable
during this cycle.

The interface will become stable once we reach 1.0.0. From this point on, only
additive changes will be introduced to the programming interface, so that the
users can upgrade to the new versions without major code changes.

The users should be aware, however, that the side effects may change without
notice even when the interface remains unchanged. This may require code changes
when upgrading to later versions.

1.0.0 user will be able to drop in 1.0.1

1.1.0 user will be able to drop in 1.1.1

1.0.0 user will be able to drop in 1.2.0

1.2.0 user will not be able to drop in 2.0.0 due to interface changes.

When the major versions are changed, the previously deprecated interfaces may
be removed; hecne requiring code changes to those users relying on the old 
interface.
