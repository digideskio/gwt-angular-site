    Unlike a pure JavaScript project, which takes no time to get started, GWT,
    like any other Java projects, requires some setting up to do to get started.
    For this tutorial, we will use <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>
    to manage the build and artifacts. The project will follow Maven project
    structure.
