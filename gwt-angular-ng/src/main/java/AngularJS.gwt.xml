  This GWT module in the default package is a bit of a workaround. We have some
  resources downloaded by bower packaged inside of /angular namespace, which
  we want to make available as part of the GWT compiler output. Because the
  public path must be relative, we cannot declare this inside of NG.gwt.xml,
  which is the visible interface to the GWT/Java world. We inherit this "hidden"
  AngularJS module which is inside the default package, which makes the bower
  managed resource available at runtime.f
